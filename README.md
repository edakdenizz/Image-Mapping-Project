Bird’s-Eye View Mapping Project Overview

This project focuses on generating bird’s-eye view (aerial) maps using computer vision and deep learning techniques. By leveraging satellite imagery, drone footage, or other aerial data sources, the system aims to create high-precision segmented maps for various applications, such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster response.

Objectives
Develop an image segmentation model to accurately classify and map different land features.
Utilize deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) and libraries like OpenCV for image processing.
Improve object detection and classification for roads, buildings, vegetation, and water bodies.
Ensure the scalability and efficiency of the mapping system for real-world applications.
